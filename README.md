•Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)
    - LT0 = Before taking LT0, I had heard about GitHub but didn't fully comprehend its purpose and functionality. I became fascinated when I learned about its capabilities, such as code cloning and the collaborative potential it offers for working on projects with others.

    - LT1 = In LT1, I embarked on some mini projects before the last semester break. I developed an interest in HTML and CSS, subjects I hadn't paid much attention to during my high school days, leaving me somewhat clueless initially. My projects focused on creating blogs about both well-known and lesser-known historical figures and events. Although the designs were plain and simple, I have since resumed exploring HTML and CSS, and I've made notable progress. However, I acknowledge that there is still much more to learn and enhance in these areas.

    - M1M2
    In M1M2, I delved into responsive design with media queries and explored basic animation for the first time. I believe I've built a solid foundational understanding, but I recognize the need for further improvement and enhancements in these areas.

•	Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, M1M2
    - LT0 = My primary difficulty lies in connecting my personal website to my GitHub account. Despite seeking guidance from my professor during a Teams call, I continue to encounter challenges in establishing this connection.

    - LT1 = In LT1, my major challenge revolved around design. Personally, creativity isn't my strong suit, making    it difficult to craft my own personal website. Consequently, I find myself frequently altering the entire website and experimenting with three different designs.

    - M1M2 = My primary challenge revolves around responsive design, particularly with media queries. While I have gained a better understanding, there is still room for improvement in my comprehension of this aspect.

•	How you could improve your website in the future
    - Possibly, I'm looking to delve deeper into CSS, exploring advanced features like transitions while acknowledging there's much more to learn for continuous improvement. I've observed that my CSS groupings appear a bit chaotic, and I'm keen on refining their organization for better structure and readability.

•	Other thoughts that might be noteworthy
    -  practicing and engaging in continuous learning. Additionally, I am interested in collaborating with my classmates to gather feedback on the design, seeking ways to further enhance its appeal and overall quality.

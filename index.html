    Alexander the Great was an ancient Macedonian
    ruler and one of history’s greatest military minds
    who, as King of Macedonia and Persia,
    established the largest empire the ancient world
    had ever seen. By turns charismatic and ruthless
    brilliant and power hungry, diplomatic and
    bloodthirsty, Alexander inspired such loyalty in    
    his men they’d follow him anywhere and, if
    necessary, die in the process. Though Alexander
    the Great died before realizing his dream of
    uniting a new realm, his influence on Greek and
    Asian culture was so profound that it inspired a
    new historical epoch—the Hellenistic Period.

        Alexander III was born in Pella, Macedonia, 
        in 356 B.C. to King Philip II and
        Queen Olympias—although legend
        had it his father
        was none other than Zeus, the ruler of the 
        Greek gods.
        
        From age 13 to 16 he was taught by Aristotle,
        who inspired him with an interest in 
        philosophy, medicine, and scientific
        investigation, but he was later
        to advance beyond his teacher’s
        narrow precept that non-Greeks should be treated
        as slaves.
